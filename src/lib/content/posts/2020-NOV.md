Everything we do, as product teams, will either earn, keep, or undermine trust. From unit testing to marketing, it all affects trust. The trust between teams and team members, employees and managers, companies and customers will play a part in your success. Building and maintaining trust requires intention and dedication. And if you've lost it, it's hard to get back. I'll share what I've learned by studying accessibility and inclusion as a web developer. I'll talk about the strategies and tactics teams can use to create long-lasting positive relationships with users. We'll also look at some pitfalls to avoid. Join me if you like the idea of a web you can trust.
