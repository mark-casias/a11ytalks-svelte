description: "Inclusivity is at the heart of an effective content strategy. Accessible code may be imperative for inclusion, but all the code in the world doesn't do any good if the content is not meaningful to our readers. In this session, we'll go over what we can do as content authors to ensure our readers feel that we are speaking with them, not at them. We'll look beyond the semantic markup and structured content to see the strategic value of inclusive, well-written content."

Job postings, among so many other things, can be unintentionally exclusive.

"We are currently looking for the next Rockstars to join our stellar team! All employees must have a killer work ethic and offer fanatical customer service."

Inclusivity is at the heart of an effective content strategy. Accessible code may be imperative for inclusion, but all the code in the world doesn't do any good if the content is not meaningful to our readers.

In this session, we'll go over what we can do as content authors to ensure our readers feel that we are speaking with them, not at them. We'll look beyond the semantic markup and structured content to see the strategic value of inclusive, well-written content.
