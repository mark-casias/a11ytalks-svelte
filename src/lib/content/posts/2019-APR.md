Like a lot of people, you have come to realize that accessibility is an important part of everyone’s job if you work on the web. Whether you’re in design, development, QA, or account management, you’re interested in being part of the solution, right? So now you’re ready to move it up a notch, and looking for ideas to help you get it done.

In this talk, I’ll talk about some tools and actions that I’ve used in the past year to help me to improve my accessibility game. Participants will walk away with a punch list of actionable ideas, many of which can be implemented on a day-to-day basis without disrupting your workflow. Before you know it, you’ll be making a difference every day! It's a long and winding road, so pack a lunch and enjoy the journey!
