Adopting an accessible marketing strategy can save time and money but what does that look like? In this session, we’ll talk through practical ways to incorporate accessibility into the marketing practices you’re already doing. Come away from this session with an understanding of:
- Creating user stories and a brand that are inclusive
- Develop a content strategy and plan for an accessible presence
- Prepare your media to reach a broader audience and more!

Marketing should be fun and accessibility should be easy: let’s try to breathe that into both of these to meet your needs in a more organic way.
